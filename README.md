# reinstatement_fidelity
The code found in this repository aims to reproduce the results reported in "TBC". In order to reproduce the analysis, you must download the data from "TBC". Then, run the script "additional_fmri_preprocessing.m", which will convert the raw fMRI files into preprocessed images. From there, run whichever analysis you please.

The main result scripts should function independently of one another, though the supplementary scripts may have some dependencies.

You will need to adapt file paths accordingly.

Please let me know if any functions/variables are missing.
